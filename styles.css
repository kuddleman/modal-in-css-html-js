  1) remember on the presentation we want to briefly hide the background of the modal overlay? hint: look at the notes below! rgba...

/*
======== Helpers
  - rgba = red, green blue, alpha (alpha being the opacity on a scale of 0 to 1 - 0.5 sounds good?)
  - rgba is complex and it's a bit of a time sink to remember all the values, look at rgba colour values online, or rgba colour convetors, or even colour palettes!
  - if you come from a design background, you'll know you can convert HEX values (e.g. #ffffff to rgba using a convertor)
